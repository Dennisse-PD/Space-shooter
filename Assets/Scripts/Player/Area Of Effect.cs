    /* To-Do List:
     * Find a way to make the AoE ShockWave Effect. I should Already know how to trigger the animation.
     * But if I go with enable, how should I handle collisions?
     * Program the collision behavior: Should the player toss a "bomb" then that detonates and the showaves comes out?
     * Make the coroutine so that it lasts only 5 second or so, and make it spawn rarely
     * Call the method from the Power-Up Script. Look at other power-ups for reference
